# PHP Logic

This repository demonstrates how PHP works by creating logical functions, conditionals, arrays and others essential logical structs.

I described every single step in archive logica.php

The firsts steps to understand a language was to apply the struct "echo", conditionals "if" and "else". After that, we learned about concatenate strings using ".".

Also we created loops like for , while , do-while and switch case.
