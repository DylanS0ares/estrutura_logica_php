# PHP Logic
###
This repository demonstrates how PHP works by creating logical functions, conditionals, arrays and others essential logical structs.

I described every single step in archive logica.php

The firsts steps to understand a language was to apply the struct "echo", conditionals "if" and "else". After that, we learned about concatenate strings using ".".

Also we created loops like for , while , do-while and switch case.

Basics Terminal Command:

cd ..  --  Close folder. <br>
dir    --  Directory/Show all folders and archives.<br>
cd     --  It goes to folder.<br>


Created Index.php

git init (new repository) <br>
git branch name of the branch (new branch) <br>

Today we are seeing about the types of branches <br>

Feature -- a lot of branches without comunications<br>
Hotfix  -- fix right now <br>
Bugfix  -- fix in the next release<br>

In this basic programmer I intend to use some configurations about html so I learned about blink during 1s and add a part of color with "font" and "p"

In this day we're going manipulate arrays:
    - The first function was to remove the first element using array_shift()<br>;
    - the function unset take off an element that you specific<br>;
    - To take off the last element we usually use array_pop()<br>;
    - Another function that was so much used it is array_reverse , who it can reverse all elements in an array<br>;
    - The last functions was used sort and rsort where asort is increasing and rsort decreasing

I also use the algorithm about bubble sort it's more intuitive than just apply some function.<br> 

Well let me explain how it works:
- It classifies the first element in this bubble with a two elements, if you are using increasing it will be the maximum among them ,It'll be done until the first being the large among them. It is the same logic in decreasing but it's the minimum.<br>


- Other function in atribution was implode , Usually it used to put some sequencial arrays as example implode(" ,",$array)<br>
- The next step in class was use associative array then we could apply in database in future classes.
